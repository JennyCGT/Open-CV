# Open-CV

## Search code
The Seach.py file is a code to search for a template in an image base using OpenCV.
The main goal is to divide the image of a cat into a grid, and a template image will be compared to each element in the grid. When the match is detected, the item will change to grayscale and its border will change color.
### Template
<p align="center">
<img src="Search/4.jpg" class="img-responsive" > 
</p>  

### Final Result
<p align="center">
<img src="images/cat1.JPG" class="img-responsive" height="275"> 
<img src="images/cat2.JPG" class="img-responsive" height="275"> 
</p>
